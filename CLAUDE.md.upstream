# Claude Code Project Guide

## Purpose
This repo is a Claude Code plugin marketplace. It ships two plugins: **flow** and **flow-next**.

## Structure
- Marketplace manifest: `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
- Plugins live in `plugins/`
- Each plugin has: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `commands/`, `skills/`, optionally `agents/`

## Plugins

### flow-next (recommended)
Zero-dependency workflow with bundled `flowctl.py`. All state in `.flow/` directory.

Commands:
- `/flow-next:plan` → creates epic + tasks in `.flow/`
- `/flow-next:work` → executes tasks with re-anchoring
- `/flow-next:interview` → deep spec refinement
- `/flow-next:plan-review` → Carmack-level plan review via rp-cli
- `/flow-next:impl-review` → Carmack-level impl review (current branch)

Ralph (autonomous loop):
- Script template lives in `plugins/flow-next/skills/flow-next-ralph-init/templates/`.
- Ralph uses `flowctl rp` wrappers (not direct rp-cli) for reviews.
- Receipts gate progress when `REVIEW_RECEIPT_PATH` is set.
- Runbooks: `plans/ralph-e2e-notes.md`, `plans/ralph-getting-started.md`.

Memory system (opt-in):
- Config in `.flow/config.json` (NOT Ralph's `config.env`)
- Enable: `flowctl config set memory.enabled true`
- Init: `flowctl memory init`
- Add: `flowctl memory add --type <pitfall|convention|decision> "content"`
- Query: `flowctl memory list`, `flowctl memory search "pattern"`
- Auto-capture: NEEDS_WORK reviews → pitfalls.md (in Ralph mode)

### flow
Original plugin with optional Beads integration. Plan files in `plans/`.

Commands:
- `/flow:plan` → writes `plans/<slug>.md`
- `/flow:work` → executes a plan
- `/flow:interview` → deep interview about spec/bead
- `/flow:plan-review` → Carmack-level plan review via rp-cli
- `/flow:impl-review` → Carmack-level impl review (current branch)

## Marketplace rules
- Keep `marketplace.json` and each plugin's `plugin.json` in sync (name, version, description, author, homepage).
- Only include fields supported by Claude Code specs.
- `source` in marketplace must point at plugin root.

## Versioning
- Use semver.
- **Bump version** when skill/phase/agent/command files change (affects plugin behavior):
  - `plugins/<plugin>/skills/**/*.md`
  - `plugins/<plugin>/agents/**/*.md`
  - `plugins/<plugin>/commands/**/*.md`
- **Don't bump** for pure README/doc changes (users don't need update)
- When bumping, update:
  - `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` → plugin version in plugins array
  - `plugins/<plugin>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` → version

## Editing rules
- Keep prompts concise and direct.
- Avoid feature flags or backwards-compatibility scaffolding (plugins are pre-release).
- Do not add extra commands/agents/skills unless explicitly requested.

## Cross-platform patterns (Claude Code + Factory Droid)

flow-next supports both Claude Code and Factory Droid. Follow these patterns:

**Variable references** — use bash fallback:
```bash
FLOWCTL="${DROID_PLUGIN_ROOT:-${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}}/scripts/flowctl"
```
- Droid sets `DROID_PLUGIN_ROOT`, Claude Code sets `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`
- Bash `${VAR:-default}` tries first, falls back to second

**Hook matchers** — use regex OR:
```json
"matcher": "Bash|Execute"
```
- Claude Code uses `Bash`, Droid uses `Execute`

**Agent permissions** — use `disallowedTools` blacklist (not `tools` whitelist):
```yaml
disallowedTools: Edit, Write, Task
```
- Whitelist fails: tool names differ (`WebFetch`/`FetchUrl`, `Bash`/`Execute`)
- Blacklist works: both platforms understand `Edit`, `Write`, `Task`

**Plugin paths** — check both directories:
```bash
PLUGIN_JSON="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/.claude-plugin/plugin.json"
[[ -f "$PLUGIN_JSON" ]] || PLUGIN_JSON="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/.factory-plugin/plugin.json"
```

## Agent workflow (Ralph + RP)

Runbooks:
- `plans/ralph-e2e-notes.md`
- `plans/ralph-getting-started.md`

Tests:
```bash
plugins/flow-next/scripts/smoke_test.sh
plugins/flow-next/scripts/ralph_smoke_test.sh
```

RP smoke (RP 1.5.68+ auto-opens window with --create, or open manually on `${TEST_DIR}/repo`):
```bash
RP_SMOKE=1 TEST_DIR=/tmp/flow-next-ralph-smoke-rpN KEEP_TEST_DIR=1 \
  plugins/flow-next/scripts/ralph_smoke_rp.sh
```

Full RP e2e (RP 1.5.68+ auto-opens window with --create, or open manually on `${TEST_DIR}/repo`):
```bash
TEST_DIR=/tmp/flow-next-ralph-e2e-rpN KEEP_TEST_DIR=1 \
  plugins/flow-next/scripts/ralph_e2e_rp_test.sh
```

Short RP e2e (2 tasks, faster iteration):
```bash
CREATE=1 TEST_DIR=/tmp/flow-next-ralph-e2e-short-rpN \
  plugins/flow-next/scripts/ralph_e2e_short_rp_test.sh
# With RP 1.5.68+: windows auto-open. Older: open RP on test repo, re-run without CREATE
```

RP gotchas (must follow):
- Use `flowctl rp` wrappers only (no direct `rp-cli`).
- Resolve numeric window id via `flowctl rp pick-window --repo-root "$REPO_ROOT"` before builder.
- Do not call `flowctl rp builder` without `--window` and `--summary`.
- Write receipt JSON after chat returns when `REVIEW_RECEIPT_PATH` is set.

Debug envs (optional, Ralph only):
```bash
FLOW_RALPH_CLAUDE_MODEL=claude-opus-4-6
FLOW_RALPH_CLAUDE_DEBUG=hooks
FLOW_RALPH_CLAUDE_VERBOSE=1
FLOW_RALPH_CLAUDE_PERMISSION_MODE=bypassPermissions
FLOW_RALPH_CLAUDE_NO_SESSION_PERSISTENCE=1
```

### Developing with local changes

**Preferred: local marketplace install** (hooks work correctly):
```bash
# From this repo root
/plugin marketplace add ./
/plugin install flow-next@gmickel-claude-marketplace

# Test in any project - plugin hooks work via ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}
```

Uninstall global version first if installed: `claude plugins uninstall flow-next`

**Alternative: --plugin-dir** (test scripts only):

Bug #14410: Plugin hooks don't fire when using `--plugin-dir`. Subagents get `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` literal instead of expanded path.

Test scripts (`ralph_smoke_test.sh`, `ralph_e2e_rp_test.sh`) handle this by copying hooks to `.claude/hooks/` in the test repo. This workaround is only needed for automated tests using `--plugin-dir`.

See `plans/ralph-e2e-notes.md` for full --plugin-dir hook setup if needed.

Logs:
- Ralph run logs: `scripts/ralph/runs/<run>/`
- Verbose log: `scripts/ralph/runs/<run>/ralph.log`
- Receipts: `scripts/ralph/runs/<run>/receipts/`
- Claude jsonl: `~/.claude/projects/**/<session_id>.jsonl`

## Release checklist (flow-next)

1. Run `./scripts/bump.sh <patch|minor|major> flow-next`
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with `[flow-next X.Y.Z]` entry
3. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add -A && git commit -m "chore(flow-next): bump version to X.Y.Z"
   git push
   ```
4. Tag to trigger release + Discord notification:
   ```bash
   git tag flow-next-vX.Y.Z && git push origin flow-next-vX.Y.Z
   ```

## Release checklist (flow)

1. Run `./scripts/bump.sh <patch|minor|major> flow` (updates versions + README badges)
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with new version entry
3. Validate JSON:
   ```bash
   jq . .claude-plugin/marketplace.json
   jq . plugins/flow/.claude-plugin/plugin.json
   ```
4. Commit, push, verify

**Manual badge locations (if not using bump script):**
- `README.md` (Flow-vX.X.X badge)
- `plugins/flow/README.md` (Version-X.X.X badge)

## Contributing / Development

Before running tests or developing plugins locally:

```bash
# Uninstall marketplace plugins to avoid conflicts with local dev versions
claude plugins uninstall flow-next
claude plugins uninstall flow
```

Global installs take precedence over `--plugin-dir`, causing tests to use stale cached versions instead of your local changes.

## Codex CLI Installation

Install flow or flow-next to OpenAI Codex (requires Codex CLI 0.102.0+):

```bash
# Clone the marketplace repo (one-time)
git clone https://github.com/gmickel/gmickel-claude-marketplace.git
cd gmickel-claude-marketplace

# Install flow-next (recommended)
./scripts/install-codex.sh flow-next

# Or install flow
./scripts/install-codex.sh flow
```

> Codex has no plugin marketplace — clone this repo to install. Everything copies to `~/.codex/`, so the clone can be deleted after (re-clone to update).

**What gets installed:**
- `~/.codex/bin/flowctl` + `flowctl.py` - CLI tool
- `~/.codex/skills/` - Skill definitions (patched for Codex paths)
- `~/.codex/agents/*.toml` - Multi-agent role configs (20 roles)
- `~/.codex/config.toml` - Agent entries merged (descriptions + config_file refs)
- `~/.codex/prompts/` - Command prompts
- `~/.codex/scripts/` - Helper scripts (worktree.sh)
- `~/.codex/templates/` - Ralph/setup templates

**Path patching:** All `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` references are automatically replaced with `~/.codex` paths during install.

**Agent conversion (multi-agent roles):** Claude Code `.md` agents → Codex `.toml` role configs:
- Frontmatter → `model`, `sandbox_mode`, reasoning settings
- Body → `developer_instructions` (backslashes auto-escaped for TOML)
- `claude-md-scout` → `agents-md-scout` (CLAUDE.md refs patched to AGENTS.md)
- Prime workflow patched: `Task flow-next:<scout>` → `Use the <scout_name> agent`

**Model mapping (3-tier):**

| Claude Code | Codex | Agents |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| `opus` | `gpt-5.4` (reasoning: high) | quality-auditor, flow-gap-analyst, context-scout |
| `claude-sonnet-4-6` (smart) | `gpt-5.4` (reasoning: high) | epic-scout, agents-md-scout, docs-gap-scout |
| `claude-sonnet-4-6` (fast) | `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` (no reasoning) | build-scout, env-scout, testing-scout, tooling-scout, observability-scout, security-scout, workflow-scout, memory-scout |
| `inherit` | inherited from parent | worker, plan-sync |

Smart scouts (epic-scout, agents-md-scout, docs-gap-scout) need deeper reasoning for context building. Remaining 8 scanning scouts run on Spark for speed. Spark agents skip `model_reasoning_effort` (not supported). `max_threads = 12` for parallel scout execution.

Override defaults:
```bash
CODEX_MODEL_INTELLIGENT=gpt-5.4 \
CODEX_MODEL_FAST=gpt-5.3-codex-spark \
CODEX_REASONING_EFFORT=high \
CODEX_MAX_THREADS=12 \
./scripts/install-codex.sh flow-next
```

**Limitations:**
- Hooks not supported (ralph-guard won't run)
- Core `/flow-next:plan` and `/flow-next:work` commands work with native multi-agent roles
- Prompts (`/prompts:*`) are global-only (`~/.codex/prompts/`). Agents, skills, and config support project-scoped `.codex/` but prompts don't yet — tracked in [openai/codex#4734](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/4734). Once shipped, add `--target <dir>` to `install-codex.sh` for project-local installs.

**Usage in Codex:**
```bash
# Add to PATH (optional)
export PATH="$HOME/.codex/bin:$PATH"

# Use flowctl directly
~/.codex/bin/flowctl --help
```

<!-- BEGIN FLOW-NEXT -->
## Flow-Next

This project uses Flow-Next for task tracking. Use `.flow/bin/flowctl` instead of markdown TODOs or TodoWrite.

**Quick commands:**
```bash
.flow/bin/flowctl list                # List all epics + tasks
.flow/bin/flowctl epics               # List all epics
.flow/bin/flowctl tasks --epic fn-N   # List tasks for epic
.flow/bin/flowctl ready --epic fn-N   # What's ready
.flow/bin/flowctl show fn-N.M         # View task
.flow/bin/flowctl start fn-N.M        # Claim task
.flow/bin/flowctl done fn-N.M --summary-file s.md --evidence-json e.json
```

**Creating a spec** ("create a spec", "spec out X", "write a spec for X"):

A spec = an epic. Create one directly — do NOT use `/flow-next:plan` (that breaks specs into tasks).

```bash
.flow/bin/flowctl epic create --title "Short title" --json
.flow/bin/flowctl epic set-plan <epic-id> --file - --json <<'EOF'
# Title

## Goal & Context
Why this exists, what problem it solves.

## Architecture & Data Models
System design, data flow, key components.

## API Contracts
Endpoints, interfaces, input/output shapes.

## Edge Cases & Constraints
Failure modes, limits, performance requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Testable criterion 1
- [ ] Testable criterion 2

## Boundaries
What's explicitly out of scope.

## Decision Context
Why this approach over alternatives.
EOF
```

After creating a spec, choose next step:
- `/flow-next:plan <epic-id>` — research + break into tasks
- `/flow-next:interview <epic-id>` — deep Q&A to refine the spec

**Rules:**
- Use `.flow/bin/flowctl` for ALL task tracking
- Do NOT create markdown TODOs or use TodoWrite
- Re-anchor (re-read spec + status) before every task

**More info:** `.flow/bin/flowctl --help` or read `.flow/usage.md`
